In this project, we implemented several different sorting algorithms.

Helper Files üôå
print_array.c: C function that prints an array of integers.
print_list.c: C function that prints a listint_t doubly-linked list.

Header Files üìÅ
sort.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions written for the project.
Data Structure:

typedef struct listint_s
{
	const int n;
	struct listint_s *prev;
	struct listint_s *next;
} listint_t;

Tasks üìÉ
0. Bubble sort

0-bubble_sort.c: C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Prints the array after each swap.
0-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Bubble Sort algorithm, one per line.
1. Insertion sort

1-insertion_sort_list.c: C function that sorts a listint_t doubly-linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
Prints the list after each swap.
1-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Insertion Sort algorithm, one per line.
2. Selection sort

2-selection_sort.c: C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm.
Prints the array after each swap.
2-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Selection Sort algorithm, one per line.
3. Quick sort

3-quick_sort.c: C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick Sort algorithm.
Implements the Lomuto partition scheme.
Always uses the last element of the partition being sorted as the pivot.
Prints the array after each swap.
3-O: Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Quick Sort Lomuto Partition scheme algorithm, one per line.
